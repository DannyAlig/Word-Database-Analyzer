# Word-Database-Analyzer
C#/.NET program which downloads a 4 MB continuous string of over 400,000 words and then 
parses the CamelCase string and analyzes the data set to find word count,
letter count of each letter, most common word, most common 2-letter prefix
and then prints all words starting with that prefix. 

Originally coded for an interview coding test.
